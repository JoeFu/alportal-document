# Time Tracking

## Units vs Minutes/Seconds

Lawyers typically track time in the form of units, where one (1) unit is equivalent to six (6) minutes. Unit calculations are always rounded up; that is, 12 minutes = 2 units, 13 minutes = 3 units, 18 minutes = 3 units.

Units are central to how time is billed, invoiced and charged to the client.

## Matters - Sales

Time spent on the Sales part of a Matter - convincing the client to purchase the service - is tracked against the Matter as "Sales" time entries.

## Matters - Matter Components

When working on a Matter, time spent on individual components are tracked against that specific component.

## Projects

When working on a task for a Project, time spent on that task is tracked against that specific task.
