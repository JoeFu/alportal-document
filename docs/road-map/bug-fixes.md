# Bugs and Small Fixes

## UI Top Bar
- Small amount of padding required around top and bottom of logo.
- Have quick button for time entry so it is just one click away at all times, as this is the most commonly used modal. 
  - currently we need to click + button and then time entry button.
- Notifications should include router link to relevant Matter, Client etc and open them up in new window so that you can look at what you have been assigned to.
## Field masking (UI library, AUS)
Standard masking for telephone numbers. Take out all spaces in data.

## Admin Pages - BgColour
Change background colour slightly so that it is obvious when you are in admin mode, like Metabase does. Maybe use light purple.
