# Email Management

Email communications are a core aspect of a lawyer's communications with their clients. As such, having a consolidated view of all of the communications between the client and the firm is desirable. To this end, all email communications are collected from Microsoft Outlook and assigned to relevant contexts where possible.

## Contacts

Emails are assigned to a Contact on the basis of their email address, that is, if they are the sender or recipient of an email, they are automatically associated with the retrieved email.

## Organisations

Emails are assigned to an Organisation on the basis of their website domain, if they have one. For instance, if their `website` is declared as `andreyev.com.au`, then all emails that are to or from an `@andreyev.com.au` email address will be associated with that organisation.

## Matters

Emails are associated with a matter automatically for emails that have the matter id in the subject line, e.g `Some subject here [1234]`. The identifier may be placed anywhere in the subject line.

Apart from this, emails should be assignable to a specific matter (TODO).
