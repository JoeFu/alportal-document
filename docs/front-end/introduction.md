# Introduction

The front end is built using Vue.js, specifically Vue 3. This project was scaffolded using Vue CLI, and therefore uses Webpack. As of the time of writing, we are remaining with the configuration provided by Vue CLI and not ejecting into our own configuration.

Notable issues with this is the slow compilation time. This is expected to improve in the next version of Vue CLI which will use Webpack 5.
