# Introduction

The frontend of this project was constructed using ***Vue.js***, specifically ***Vue 3***, which had a major upgrade from previous versions.

To streamline the development process, the project was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). 

The use of ***Vite*** has allowed us to significantly improve our compile times compared to our previous usage of ***Vue CLI***.
