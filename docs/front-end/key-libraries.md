# Key Libraries

::: tip Future

The main libraries basically support Vue3. In the selection of future libraries, we tend to choose a stable version that supports Vue3.
:::

## TypeScript

***TypeScript*** is used in this application, and helps avoid certain categories of errors. 

Vue historically has not had the best support for ***TypeScript***. This has improved significantly as of Vue 3, but still has some limitations.

You can read more about ***TypeScript*** [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Vue Router

***Vue Router*** is the standard routing library for managing routes in projects. 

You can read more about ***Vue Router*** [here](https://router.vuejs.org/).

## Vuex

***Vuex*** is the state management library used in this application. 

You can read more about ***Vuex*** [here](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).

::: tip Note

Currently ***TypeScript*** support in ***Vuex*** is limited. This is expected to improve in future versions.

[This issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/1831) is of particular interest in this context.

## Luxon

This is the library being used to handle date related operations.

::: tip Note

***Luxon*** does not support ***TypeScript*** typings as a first class citizen and relies on community contributions to keep these up to date. It is also not built to be modular and therefore it does not support tree shaking.

We may migrate to something else such as date-fns in the future which support these out of the box.
