## Offerings

An Offering describes a legal service that the firm can provide to their clients. It is essentially a template for delivering that service.

An offering is comprised of Outcomes, and Outcomes comprised of Components.

### Outcomes

An Offering outcome describes the specific outcome the firm aims to deliver for their client as part of the overall Offering. The number of Outcomes delivered will vary between Offerings.

### Components

A Component describes a specific task that needs to be completed in order to achieve the parent Outcome. This can be things like a particular document that needs to be drawn up, or providing advice specific to their circumstances.

#### Resources

Resources are tools, information or other internal or external assets that may be useful to the lawyer when completing this component. Internal resources may be things like document templates, Syntaq forms, or internal notes on the firm's standards for handling certain tasks. External resources might be links to thorough documentation on a particular area of the law.

## Matters

A matter encompasses an instance of the delivery of a legal service to a particular client. It is in effect an partial "instance" of an Offering, in that a Matter delivers an Offering to a client, but does not necessarily require that all Outcomes of an Offering are delivered. This will depend on the client's circumstances.

### Matter Outcomes

A Matter Outcome is a copy of an Offering Outcome at the point they are selected for that Matter. This is so that changes may be made to the Outcome on a Matter to Matter basis, and to avoid changes to Offerings affecting historical Matters. It retains a reference to the "original" Offering Outcome for tracking purposes, keeping in mind that the Offering Outcome may change drastically over time.

### Matter Components

As with the Matter Outcomes, this is a copy of the associated Offering Component.
