# CRM

## Contacts

Contacts are the individual people that the firm interacts with.

### Contact Relationships

Contacts can be related to each other; as family members, professional relationships, or because they were referred to the firm by them.

## Organisations

Organisations are the various companies and organisations that the firm interacts with.

## Clients

Clients are entities that the firm acts for in a legal capacity. That is, the firm handles legal "Matters" for Clients.

A Client is comprised of at least one primary Contact and optionally an Organisation and/or a secondary Contact. Unique combinations of these are considered distinct Clients; Contacts and Organisations may be part of multiple Client entities.
