## Installing Visual Studio and .NET SDKs

The simplest way to install the .NET SDKs and tooling is to install them alongside Visual Studio.

Visual Studio may be installed from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/. You should install the latest Community version.

While installing Visual Studio, you will be prompted to select the types of projects and therefore the libraries you will need. At a minimum you will need to select the ASP NET Core Web Development (or something along those lines) option. You may install other options as you see fit, but they are not required to work on the ALP application.

We are currently using .NET 5 for the back end development.
