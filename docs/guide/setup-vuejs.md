# Environment Setup - Vue.js

## Installing Node.js

Vue.js uses Webpack as its module bundler, which requires Node.js.

Node.js can be installed from https://nodejs.org/. The latest LTS version is the generally recommended version.

## Installing the Yarn Package Manager

We recommend using the Yarn package manager for managing the dependencies in the Vue.js project.

This can be installed from https://classic.yarnpkg.com/. Yarn 2 is available, however due to compability issues we currently use version 1. This may change as support in the ecosystem improves.
