# Time Tracking

Time is generally tracked for all activities performed by the staff in the firm. This applies to billable work for clients that then needs to be billed to those clients. 

It also applies to time spent on internal work so that the time investment for those projects can be quantified and the return on investment can be determined.

The core types of time entries are as follows:

### Sales Time Entries

This is time spent "selling" the client on the service that the firm is providing. This might include time spent scoping the amount of work to be done and generating the work proposal for the matter.

Typically this time is recorded when the matter is being quoted for the client. This time is generally not billable.

### Matter Time Entries

This is time spent working on specific aspects of a legal Matter. Legal matters are built up from "Outcomes" which are then composed of "Components". Time entries for matters are tracked against Matter Components as these are the specific tasks that need to be carried out by lawyers.

### Project Time Entries

This is the time spent on internal projects. Time tracked for projects is against the specific "Task".

## Timers

To assist in the recording of time, a timer functionality was introduced. In essence, a "start time" is recorded when the timer starts. When the timer is paused or stopped, the time since the "start time" is calculated and stored in seconds.

When the timer is submitted, the "units" (there are 10 units to the hour) are computed based on the total number of accumulated seconds.
